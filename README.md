## Overview
Welcome to my ePortfolio for CS499 Computer Science Capstone.  As an overview, this ePortfolio is a professional respresentation of my work, that showcases my unique abilities and talents in the Computer Science industry.  The content in my ePortfolio include some artifacts from the courses in the Computer Science Program that best represent my growth in the required key categories of: software design/engineering, algorithms and data stuctures, and databases.

## Self Reflection
During my studies in Computer Science at SNHU, I had the opportunity to explore various experiences that broadened my horizons. Computer Science is an extensive subject matter, and my coursework included a mix of highly technical classes, courses in my minor of Project Management, and everything in between. While I initially intended to transition from my role as a Business Accounting Analyst to become a Business Systems Analyst, I discovered a passion for Project Management and Agile methodologies during my five years at SNHU. My brain is wired to think about problems in an Agile manner, which enables me to quickly arrive at solutions. As my career evolves, I plan to focus on roles that allow me to further develop my problem-solving and project management skills.

However, showcasing my project management skills in my Capstone has proven challenging. While I never intended to become a computer programmer, understanding how code works and how it can be used to solve problems has been crucial. I have also become adept at fixing existing code, treating it like a game of seek and find. Learning from others has always been a passion of mine. 

In my role as a Business Accounting Analyst, I apply many of the skills I acquired during my time at SNHU in my day-to-day experiences. My responsibilities include guiding companies in their selection of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, preparing them for migration, and training their staff on the upcoming changes. I pride myself on my aptitude for sales, recognizing when to decline an opportunity and being comfortable with the consequences. Additionally, my expertise in change management has proven invaluable. These proficiencies were honed during my time at SNHU.

My coding experiences at SNHU provided me with a thorough understanding of the foundation of ERP systems. This knowledge has enabled me to effectively assist a diverse range of businesses in meeting their ERP needs, recognizing that ERP systems are essentially large databases.

The artifacts I will be sharing in this ePortfolio were two artifacts I am most proud of and felt that I was able to achieve the end goal of a product.  In this capstone class, I've had to relearn C# and Python. There were three parts to this project and one project that I've created spans over Project 1 and Project 2.  

1. Project 1: Software Design and Engineering
2. Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structure
3. Project 3: Databases

## Code Review
I have two different code reviews, as I've analyzed my two artifacts.  Each of these code reviews, I review the existing code to look for weaknesses or limitations and discuss my code enhancements.  

Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering and Algorithms and Data Structure

Artifact 2: Databases

## Project 1
[Project link](https://github.com/mistypalek/mistypalek.github.io/tree/main/Project%201)<br />
This artifact is a scene that was originally designed in CS 330 class, using OpenGL and C++ language. The object of the class was to design a scene of our choosing, to demonstrate our graphical coding skills.  This artifact was created in July of 2022. <br /> 

I’ve selected this artifact for my ePortfolio, because it was by far the most challenging piece of work, I’ve done in the past five years of attending SNHU.   The artifact was developed through a series of shapes that represent the original picture I took of a desk scene, with a fan, remote control, phone tripod, and speaker. 

The artifact uses OpenGL library for C++, which allows for graphics to be rendered with GPU (graphics processing unit).  The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills is the C++ language for each shape that needed to be rendered to make up the final scene.  Using C++, I was able to create two arrays for each object created.  One array was to hold vertexes and their data: position, normal, color, texture, and uv coordinates. The other array was used to combine vertices to make shapes, like a triangle for the phone easel that was included in the scene.<br />

The Shader in OpenGL is a user-defined program designed to run on some stage of a graphics processor. (Shader - OpenGL Wiki, n.d.). Using the shader function, I was able to create these objects (shapes) and then pass them to the projection function, which then projected them with an image, to give the idea that they were more than shapes, but actual existing objects.<br />

To improve this artifact, I was able to modify the code, to make the fan not only oscillate, turning to and fro, but also to make the fan blades spin.  The challenges I was faced with were installing MS Visual Studio again, so I could open the artifact and continue to work on the project. That was an easy fix, then once I was able to find the artifact and open the code, to start to modify it, there was the challenge of remembering C++ enough to make the changes.  Once I re-familiarized myself with the code, the actual placement of the code was not difficult.  Using “ SOHCAHTOA” which I learned in my calculus classes, I was able make the fan oscillate using sin and remembering that sin was applied to the vertices, which allowed for the fan blades to spin. <br />

For this artifact, in the software design and engineering category, I feel that I have enhanced the project as planned and have met the objectives.<br />


## Project 2
[Project link](https://github.com/mistypalek/mistypalek.github.io/tree/main/Project%202)<br />
In milestone two, Algorithms and Data Structure, I added an algorithm that allows the project in Project 1 to oscilate back and forth.  

## Project 3

In this milestone three, Databases, I’ve chosen to present my final project for the CS340 Client/Server Development assignment.  This project was full stack application development with dashboard, that easily identified dogs that are exceptional candidates for search-and-rescue training.  This artifact was developed in December of 2022. 

I’m including this project in my ePortfolio, because it showcases my ability to build a full-stack application using Jypter Notebooks, Pymongo, Python, MongoDB, JavaScript, and Mongo Shell, visually displaying the data that was mined from the Animal Shelter database.  The revision I've made is to be able to also display the sex of the ideal candidates on the dashboard. 

This artifact taught me the basic CRUD operations, to be able to interact with a NoSQL database and still be able to query the data and use CRUD to modify the data through the application. I’m very accustomed to working in SQL, so this class was quite interesting to learn the differences of how SQL is all table based, but NoSQL are key based.  By using collection management, document manipulation, and document retrieval, I was able to meet the objectives and add the sex of the animal in the dashboard.
