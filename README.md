## Overview
Welcome to my ePortfolio for CS499 Computer Science Capstone.  As an overview, this ePortfolio is a professional respresentation of my work, that showcases my unique abilities and talents in the Computer Science industry.  The content in my ePortfolio include artifacts of some of the courses in the Computer Science Program that best represent my growth in the required key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data stuctures, and databases.

## Self Reflection
Throughout my time at SNHU, studying Computer Science, I've had many different experiences to broaden my horizons.  One would think that Computer Science is somewhat a broad subject matter, and I could confirm that to be true.  I've had many very technical classes, along with many classes pertaining to my minor, Project Management, and everything in between.  Originally thinking that I wanted to focus on switching from being a Business Accounting Analyst to more of a Business Systems Analyst, I fell in love with Project Management and realized througout my five years at SNHU, that Agile was really the language of my brain.  It is how my brain thinks about problems and is able to come up with a quick solution to solve said problems. I will pursue more Project Management, and a more problem solving type roles as my career path evolves. 

That being said, these skills in project management have been hard to showcase in this Capstone.  Even though I have never intended to be a computer programmer, it was necessary to learn how code works and how it can be the basis for the solution to the problem.  It has been important for me to learn how to fix exisiting codes to solve problems and I've always looked at it like a game of seek and find.  Being able to attribute my knowledge to others has been one of my greatest life long achievements.  

I utilize many of the skills I've learned from my time at SNHU, in my every day experiences as an Business Accounting Analyst.  I help companies choose their next ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, prepare for the migration, and train their people on what's to come.  I savvy myself a very good sales person, knowing when to say no and being ok with those concequences. I am very good at change management, and having that skill to know where change is coming from has been invaluable.  All that I learned from my time at SNHU.  Understanding the foundation of a ERP system through my coding experiences at SNHU, has helped me focus on how to help a multitude of different kinds of businesses and their ERP needs.  Afterall, ERP systems are really just big databases. 

The artifacts I will be sharing in this ePortfolio were two artifacts I am most proud of and felt that I was able to achieve the end goal of a product.  In this capstone class, I've had to relearn C# and Python. There were three parts to this project and one project that I've created spans over Project 1 and Project 2.  

1. Project 1: Software Design and Engineering
2. Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structure
3. Project 3: Databases
